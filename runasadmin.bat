::Does not prevent interruption
::Does not affect Ctrl+C at all
::Only controls whether Ctrl+Break sets the internal BREAK flag
::That flag is checked by certain batch commands (FOR, COPY, etc.) to decide whether to abort early.


:: ctrl+c is trapped by our .exe by putting the terminal in raw mode, thus this .bat won't sense it and ask to terminate batch job.

echo Script is running from "%~dp0"
rem cd /d is a built-in that parses the path differently, it accepts the trailing ^ literally and changes the working directory.
rem No, lol, it's because of this: "When you do just echo "%~dp0", CMD treats %~dp0 as a standalone token inside quotes, and it preserves the trailing ^ because it’s not immediately followed by another character. So you see the caret in your output. But when you do concatenation... caret is interpreted as an escape → lost."

:: %0 → the path used to launch the script
:: ~d → drive letter
