:: (nope:)disallow Ctrl+break, no effect, it still prompts: Terminate batch job (Y/N)?
::break off
::so, break off:
::Does not disable Ctrl+Break
::Does not prevent interruption
::Does not affect Ctrl+C at all
::Only controls whether Ctrl+Break sets the internal BREAK flag
::That flag is checked by certain batch commands (FOR, COPY, etc.) to decide whether to abort early.


:: ctrl+c is trapped by our .exe by putting the terminal in raw mode, thus this .bat won't sense it and ask to terminate batch job.

echo Current working directory is on next line:

echo Script is running from "%~dp0"
rem cd /d is a built-in that parses the path differently, it accepts the trailing ^ literally and changes the working directory.
rem No, lol, it's because of this: "When you do just echo "%~dp0", CMD treats %~dp0 as a standalone token inside quotes, and it preserves the trailing ^ because it’s not immediately followed by another character. So you see the caret in your output. But when you do concatenation... caret is interpreted as an escape → lost."

:: %0 → the path used to launch the script
:: ~d → drive letter
:: ~p → path (ending with a backslash)

:: cd /d changes the driver letter too
