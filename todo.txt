* make it 'pause' even when errors happen, else i need to wrap it in a .bat!
* show the IPs gotten from upstream in logs, even if cached, even if HTTPS dns type!(even tho stripped ipv4hint etc.)
* hide the upstream url from config.json maybe point to another file for it as it contains the ID used by nextdns for example and can't git commit that!
  * get the NEXTDNS_ID from env or from cmdline? not cmdline, it appears in task manager!
  * maybe use a pattern to reference a file with the current path where config.json is as the default implied path, like %id.key% which opens .\id.key file and puts that value in its place if %id.key% appears in the config.json
  * or like: {file:id.key}
* append the exe that made the query for the specific hostname to the nextdns upstream url so the exe appears in nextdns' logs!
  like in DoH Path only as: "{clientexe}"
* separate the whitelist and blacklist away from config.json
* link to Tinywall in readme and to Go lang to install Go.
* add config key for that NOERROR AAAA block to run only if true
